# THING

You'll need basically any version of node installed.

## Get Started

- Set your .env variables. 
- `cd` to this directory
- `npm install`

To import a folder, run:
`node import.js run <subdirectory-in-html-folder>`

For example you're trying to import `./html/IT-stuff`, your PATH_TO_HTML would be set to `./html` and subdirectory-in-html-folder would be set to `IT-stuff`

## Nuke
If an import gets messed up, you can delete everything by running:
`node nuke.js`
